# Boat races
# Each race is allocated x ms to run
# Boat speed charges 1 mm/s per ms
# Boat speed is constant and travels for y ms where y is x - charge time
# Distance = boat speed * y
# For each race you need to beat the record from puzzle_input
# For each race determine the number of ways to beat the record = z
# Final answer is product of z
